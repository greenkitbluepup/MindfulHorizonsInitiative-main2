      <h1 class="text-3xl md:text-4xl font-bold">Talking to a Friend About Anxiety</h1>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">By Jordan Rivera (Fictional Author)</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700">Talking about anxiety is difficult, especially when the person experiencing it is someone you care about. Many people want to help but worry about saying the wrong thing or making the situation worse. While there is no perfect script, compassionate communication can make a meaningful difference.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700">Supporting a friend with anxiety begins with listening, understanding, and patience.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Understanding What Anxiety Feels Like</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Anxiety is more than occasional worry. For many people, it can feel overwhelming, persistent, and physically exhausting. It may show up as racing thoughts, constant fear, difficulty breathing, restlessness, or avoidance of certain situations.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">What’s important to remember is that anxiety is not a choice. Telling someone to “just relax” or “stop worrying” can unintentionally make them feel misunderstood or dismissed.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Creating a Safe Space to Talk</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Before starting the conversation, choose a moment when your friend feels relatively calm and unhurried. Privacy and comfort matter.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">When you talk:</p>
      <ul class="text-gray-700 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Speak calmly and without judgment</li>
        <li>Let them share at their own pace</li>
        <li>Avoid interrupting or rushing to fix the problem</li>
        <li>Validate their feelings, even if you don’t fully understand them</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Sometimes the most helpful thing you can say is, “I’m here with you.”</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">What to Say and What to Avoid</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Words have weight, especially during vulnerable moments.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 font-semibold">Helpful phrases include:</p>
      <ul class="text-gray-700 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>“That sounds really overwhelming.”</li>
        <li>“I’m glad you told me.”</li>
        <li>“You’re not weak for feeling this way.”</li>
        <li>“How can I support you right now?”</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 font-semibold">Phrases to avoid:</p>
      <ul class="text-gray-700 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>“Everyone feels anxious sometimes.”</li>
        <li>“Just think positive.”</li>
        <li>“It’s not that big of a deal.”</li>
        <li>“You’ll get over it.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Even well-intended comments can feel dismissive if they minimize the experience.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Listening Is More Important Than Fixing</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">You don’t need to have answers or solutions. Anxiety often isn’t something that can be quickly fixed, and trying to solve it may unintentionally pressure your friend.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Instead:</p>
      <ul class="text-gray-700 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Listen without judgment</li>
        <li>Reflect what they share to show understanding</li>
        <li>Ask gentle, open-ended questions</li>
        <li>Respect their boundaries</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Being present and supportive is often more valuable than offering advice.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Encouraging Professional Support</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">If your friend’s anxiety is significantly impacting their daily life, gently encouraging professional help can be beneficial. This doesn’t mean forcing the idea or making them feel broken.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">You might say:</p>
      <ul class="text-gray-700 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>“Have you thought about talking to a counselor?”</li>
        <li>“If you ever want help finding resources, I can help.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Let them decide when and how to seek support. Your role is to encourage, not to pressure.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Taking Care of Yourself Too</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Supporting someone with anxiety can be emotionally demanding. It’s okay to set boundaries and acknowledge your own needs. You cannot carry someone else’s anxiety for them.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Make sure you:</p>
      <ul class="text-gray-700 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Check in with your own emotions</li>
        <li>Avoid taking responsibility for their mental health</li>
        <li>Seek support if you feel overwhelmed</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Healthy support works best when both people are cared for.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">The Power of Being There</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">You don’t need perfect words to help someone with anxiety. Compassion, patience, and consistency go a long way. Even small gestures, like checking in or sitting quietly together, can make someone feel less alone.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Sometimes, simply reminding a friend that they are seen and supported can be one of the most grounding things you offer.</p>
