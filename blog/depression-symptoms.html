      <p class="text-sm text-gray-600">By Jordan Alvarez (Fictional Author)</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700">Depression is more than feeling sad or having a bad day. It is a mental health condition that can affect how a person thinks, feels, and functions in daily life. Because its symptoms can develop gradually, many people do not realize they are experiencing depression until it begins interfering with school, work, relationships, or personal well-being.</p>

      <p class="text-gray-700">Recognizing the signs of depression is an important first step toward understanding what is happening and seeking appropriate support.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">What Depression Is and What It Is Not</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Depression is not a weakness, a lack of motivation, or something a person can simply “snap out of.” It is a real medical and psychological condition influenced by biological, emotional, and environmental factors.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Everyone feels sad or discouraged at times, but depression is different in both intensity and duration. When symptoms last for weeks or months and affect daily functioning, they may indicate something more serious.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Emotional Signs of Depression</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">One of the most noticeable aspects of depression involves changes in mood and emotional responses. These feelings often persist even when circumstances improve.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 font-semibold">Common emotional symptoms include:</p>
      <ul class="text-gray-700 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Persistent sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness</li>
        <li>Feeling numb or emotionally disconnected</li>
        <li>Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed</li>
        <li>Increased irritability or frustration, especially over small things</li>
        <li>Feelings of guilt, shame, or worthlessness</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Some people with depression describe feeling nothing at all, which can be just as distressing as intense sadness.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Cognitive and Thought-Related Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Depression can strongly influence how a person thinks about themselves, others, and the future. These thought patterns may feel automatic and difficult to control.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 font-semibold">Cognitive symptoms may include:</p>
      <ul class="text-gray-700 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Difficulty concentrating or making decisions</li>
        <li>Slowed thinking or racing negative thoughts</li>
        <li>Excessive self-criticism</li>
        <li>Feeling like a burden to others</li>
        <li>Pessimistic or hopeless views about the future</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700">These thoughts are symptoms of depression, not accurate reflections of reality.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Physical and Behavioral Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Depression does not only affect emotions and thoughts. It can also impact the body and daily habits.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 font-semibold">Physical and behavioral signs may include:</p>
      <ul class="text-gray-700 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
        <li>Fatigue or low energy, even after rest</li>
        <li>Changes in sleep patterns (sleeping too much or too little)</li>
        <li>Changes in appetite or weight</li>
        <li>Withdrawing from friends, family, or social activities</li>
        <li>Difficulty completing everyday tasks</li>
        <li>Loss of motivation or slowed movement</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Because these symptoms can resemble stress or burnout, depression is sometimes overlooked or dismissed.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Depression Looks Different for Everyone</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">There is no single way depression appears. Some people continue to function outwardly while struggling internally, while others may experience visible changes in behavior or mood. Cultural expectations, personality, and age can all influence how symptoms show up.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">For example, teens and young adults may show depression through irritability, academic struggles, or social withdrawal rather than sadness. Adults may push through responsibilities while feeling emotionally exhausted or detached.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">When to Seek Help</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">If symptoms persist for more than two weeks, worsen over time, or interfere with daily life, it may be time to seek support. This can begin with talking to a trusted person, such as a friend, family member, teacher, or counselor.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Professional help from a mental health provider can offer assessment, guidance, and treatment options. Depression is highly treatable, and early support often leads to better outcomes.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">If thoughts of self-harm or suicide are present, immediate help is critical. Reaching out to emergency services or crisis support lines can save lives.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6">Moving Toward Understanding and Support</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Recognizing depression symptoms is not about labeling yourself or others. It is about gaining clarity and compassion for what someone may be experiencing. Awareness creates space for understanding, connection, and healing.</p>
      <p class="text-gray-700">Depression can make people feel isolated, but no one has to face it alone. With the right support, recovery is possible, and help is available.</p>
